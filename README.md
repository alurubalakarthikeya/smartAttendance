<h1>Smart Attendance Project</h1>
<p><b>Automated Attendance:</b> Students scan their IDs using QR when
entering and leaving the lecture hall.<br>
<b>Database Check:</b> The system verifies the ID with the university
database for accurate attendance.<br>
<b>Admin Dashboard:</b> Professors can view and manage attendance
through a simple web interface.</p>
<p>The use of QR code for ID
scanning and integration with
a database for attendance
tracking is technically viable.
Technologies such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and
MongoDB are well-suited for
this implementation. Protecting sensitive student
data from unauthorized access
or breaches requires strong
security measures. Students
and faculty may need time to
adapt to the new system, and
there could be resistance or
usability issues. Improves accuracy and
efficiency in large lecture halls.
This will streamline the
attendance process, reducing
errors and saving time for both
students and faculty. Reduces
the need for physical
attendance sheets.</p>
